This repository contains the posters and beamer slides that I presented at conferences while I was an undergraduate mathematics major participating in the University of Texas at El Paso's Undergraduate Participation in Bioinformatics Training [(UPBiT)](http://www.bioinformatics.utep.edu/UPBiT/index.php) program.

The pdfs will likely need to be downloaded if you wish to view them, as GitHub may display an error when trying to view them on the site.
